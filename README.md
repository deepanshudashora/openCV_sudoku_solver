# opencv_sudoku_solover

In this sudoku solver I am uploading the image of sudoku and trying to solve it with opencv and cnn model

So first i preprocessed the image which is in final_output file.
for that I also needed a model which can detect which image sudoku is having in that particular grid for this model I used mnist dataset.
now I am taking the imput data preprocessing it and fitting into the model after this i am making a sudoku with it and fitting it into the solver function.
now when sudoku is solved i am getting the output image
